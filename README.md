# vdat-lite

Docker image based on [r-hub/r-minimal](https://github.com/r-hub/r-minimal).

Current image is not too lightweight (2.05GB), but most of that (1.5BGB!) is due to Wine. On the R side, everything needs to be compiled so it can take a long time (upwards of 15 minutes) to build! This is suggested for those who are willing to wait a little longer for something a little lighter.
